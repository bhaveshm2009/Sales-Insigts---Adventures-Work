# Sales Insigts - Adventures-Work

# Objective
Creating a report from set of records and overview it without any errors is a tough challenge.
To overcome this problem DataAnalysis takes place. Data analysis is to gain insights into the performance of sales activities, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve sales efficiency, revenue, and profitability. By analyzing sales data, we can understand customer behavior, identify opportunities for cross-selling and upselling, track the performance of sales channels, and measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. The ultimate goal is to optimize the sales process, improve customer satisfaction, and drive business growth.

 # Tools used for Analysis -
 
 - PowerBI
 - Adv.Excel

 # Mapping into Aanalysis -
 
 Based on the objective and data given in format like CSV files. We are supposed to extract the data, 
 cleaning the data, analyse the data and visualization of data on the basis of output objective.
 
 - ### ETL (Extract , Transfrom , Load).
   Extracting the data from different source systems, then Transforms the data (like applying calculations, concatenations, etc.) 
   and finally Loads the data into the Data Warehouse system.
 - ### Data cleaning 
   Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data 
   within a dataset.
 - ### Data Transfromation
   Data Transfromation is the process of converting data from one format to another, typically from the format of a source system 
   into the required format of a destination system. Data transformation is a component of most data integration and data management
   tasks, such as data wrangling and data warehousing.
 - ### Data Analytics
   Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data in order to make conclusions about that information. Many of the techniques and 
   processes of data analytics have been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption.
 - ### Using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
   Used to create custom calculations and metrics for data analysis. DAX is a functional programming language that allows users to define and manipulate data in Power    BI to create powerful and interactive data models.
   With DAX, users can perform complex calculations and create custom expressions that can be used in visualizations, tables, and charts. It supports a wide range of
   functions and operators, such as SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, IF, AND, OR, and many more. DAX is a powerful tool that enables users to perform data analysis at a 
   granular level and obtain insights into their data in real-time.
